# TimesheetCalculator
A python timesheet calculator. Very much still a work in progress, but still functional.

This project is used to track time divided into different sections.
You should only need python to run this project, however you may need to install additional modules such as pillow.

There are still a lot of bugs in the script, but please post any found issues in the "Issues" section of the github page.

This script is a side project of mine, so updates may be slow. But I still plan on fixing the bugs and adding new features in the future.
